/* Unlike the typical distill websites shown in the examples online, I did not want a title YAML/text in the beginning and the first thing I wanted was an image. So this function below, borrowed from a google search, gets rid of the requirement of a title & uses css to do the same. You can delete this code chunk if you want to include a title in your website */
