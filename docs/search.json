Lisa Yang Center for Conservation Bioacoustics, Cornell Lab of Ornithology. My research is focused on understanding how the environment shapes the ecology and behavior of tropical montane birds. My research uses an interdisciplinary and collaborative approach that borrows from conservation bioacoustics, community science, and historical ecology.\r\nemail: vr292@cornell.edu\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

These projects involved listening to over 150 hours of audio recordings and manually annotating the presence/absence of every bird species in those recordings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\nAkshay V Anand\r\n\r\nResearch assistant (2020 - 2022)Current: Graduate Student, University of Florida\r\nAkshay was a research assistant on a bioacoustics and a historical resurvey project across the Anamalai and the Nilgiri hills of the Western Ghats. He manually annotated acoustic data from the Anamalai hills & carried out extensive fieldwork across the Nilgiri hills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmrutha Rajan\r\n\r\nResearch assistant (2020 - 2022)Current: Project Assistant, Keystone Foundation\r\nAmrutha digitized historical land cover data and carrying out fieldwork across the Nilgiris.\r\n\r\nCollaborators\r\nI believe that science is a team-effort and none of the work I do would be possible without collaborations and partnerships.
