Lisa Yang Center for Conservation Bioacoustics, Cornell Lab of Ornithology. My research is focused on understanding how the environment shapes the ecology and behavior of tropical montane birds. My research uses an interdisciplinary and collaborative approach that borrows from conservation bioacoustics, community science, and historical ecology.\r\nemail: vr292@cornell.edu\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
