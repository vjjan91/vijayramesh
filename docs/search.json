Lisa Yang Center for Conservation Bioacoustics, Cornell Lab of Ornithology. My research is focused on understanding how the environment shapes the ecology and behavior of tropical montane birds. My research uses an interdisciplinary and collaborative approach that borrows from conservation bioacoustics, community science, and historical ecology.\r\nemail: vr292@cornell.edu\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

A common thread in my experience working with birds has been the terrain that I have studied them in: mountains. I use a wide array of tools and techniques to test fundamental ecological theory and its applications.\r\nThere are three broad lenses through which I study bird communities: Conservation Bioacoustics, Historical Ecology, and citizen science.\r\nTo learn more about the current list of active projects and geographies we work in, please visit this page.\r\nConservation Bioacoustics\r\nBioacoustics offers us a unique opportunity to study wildlife and their environment. Passive acoustic monitoring devices are capable of monitoring vocalizing biodiversity across broad spatial scales for extended periods of time and allows us to study multiple taxonomic groups simultaneously. Presently, we are working on a range of projects that includes tracking and monitoring bird vocal activity across habitats, understanding the drivers of the dawn chorus, documenting soundscapes in coffee farms, recording vocalizations of an endangered primate, using AI to carry out automated recognition of sounds etc. To learn more, please visit the link at the top of this page.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Work published in Biological Conservation showed that active restoration helped increase bird species diversity compared to natural regeneration. Pictured here is an illustration of bird communities across a naturally regenerating (NR), actively restored (AR) and benchmark forests (BM) in the Anamalai hills, Western Ghats.

Bonus points if you can spot the audio recorder!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Dhvani\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nPooja Choksi, Sarika Khanwilkar and I co-founded Project Dhvani in 2018, and we are a research collaborative that uses sound to monitor biodiversity and inform resource management. To learn more about the projects we do, please visit the link above.\r\n\r\nHistorical Ecology\r\nThe field of historical ecology aims to taps into a plethora of historical datasets available to inform biodiversity conservation. Using data from historical maps, satellite images, diaries of ornithologists and old journal articles, we study the impacts of landscape and climate change on bird communities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: An 1848 land cover map of the Nilgiri hills, based on a survey carried out by Captain John Ouchterlony. Sources: Tamil Nadu State Archive and the British Library.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCitizen Science\r\nThe advent of large-scale citizen science datasets has now made it possible to carry out a wide range of research across a number of species, including mapping species distributions and prioritizing conservation efforts. Using data from the world’s largest citizen science database, eBird, we study how the environment shapes species behavior, habitat use and its distribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: Using data from eBird, we showed that thermal regimes are key in constraining elevational migration in Himalayan birds (Menon et al. 2023). In the Western Ghats of south India, we showed that temperature seasonality was a key driver of bird species occupancy (Ramesh et al. 2022).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
