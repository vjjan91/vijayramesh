```{css}
/* Unlike the typical distill websites shown in the examples online, I did not want a title YAML/text in the beginning and the first thing I wanted was an image. So this function below, borrowed from a google search, gets rid of the requirement of a title & uses css to do the same. You can delete this code chunk if you want to include a title in your website */

d-title {
    display: none;
  }
  
/* We also do not want the date to be displayed when the overview of research themes are published, so we set the entire css element (here it's the metadata) to none */

.metadata  {
    display: none;
}

/* I also made slight modifications to enlarge the thumbnail, because the date is no longer being displayed/shown. */

.posts-list .post-preview .thumbnail { 
    width: 50%; 
}

/* I made a modification to exclude the title of this .Rmd being displayed in the webpage */
.posts-list .posts-list-caption {
    display: none;
}

/* remove extra space in between the first research theme preview and the text right above it */

.posts-list {
    margin-top: 0;

I use an interdisciplinary and collaborative approach that borrows from conservation bioacoustics, historical ecology, and citizen science
