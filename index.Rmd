/* Unlike the typical distill websites shown in the examples online, I did not want a title YAML/text in the beginning and the first thing I wanted was an image. So this function below, borrowed from a google search, gets rid of the requirement of a title & uses css to do the same. You can delete this code chunk if you want to include a title in your website */

## Welcome!  

I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the [K. Lisa Yang Center for Conservation Bioacoustics, Cornell Lab of Ornithology](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/ccb/). My research is focused on understanding how the environment shapes the ecology and behavior of tropical montane birds. I use an interdisciplinary and collaborative approach that borrows from conservation bioacoustics, community science, and historical ecology.
